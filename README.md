# Keylogger App

The Keylogger App is a simple Python application that logs keystrokes on the keyboard and stores them in a text file. It uses the `pynput` library to capture key presses and releases. This README provides information on how to use and customize the Keylogger App.

## Features
- Logs key presses (printable characters) to a specified log file.
- Handles special keys (e.g., Enter, Space) and non-printable characters.
- Provides an option to customize the log file name.

## Requirements
To use the Keylogger App, you need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- The `pynput` library. You can install it using pip:
  ```
  pip install pynput
  ```

## Usage

### Running the App
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x and `pynput` library installed on your system.
2. Execute the Python script.

   ```
   python keylogger_app.py
   ```

### Logging Keystrokes
1. The Keylogger App will start running and listening to keyboard events.

### Stopping the Keylogger
1. To stop the Keylogger, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it is running.
2. The logged keystrokes will be saved in the log file specified.

## Customization
The Keylogger App can be customized and enhanced based on your specific requirements. Here are some customization options:

- **Customize the Log File**: You can specify a different log file name by modifying the `LOG_FILE` variable in the code.

- **Enhance Logging**: You can enhance the logging logic to capture additional information such as timestamps or the application context in which keys are pressed.

- **Add Remote Data Transfer**: You can extend the app to send logged data to a remote server or store it in a more secure manner.

- **Implement Data Encryption**: For security purposes, you can implement data encryption to protect the logged information.

- **Improve Error Handling**: Enhance error handling to handle exceptions and edge cases gracefully.

Feel free to explore and adapt the code to meet your specific needs. However, please use this application responsibly and ensure it complies with all relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Unauthorized use of keyloggers may infringe on privacy rights and could be illegal.
